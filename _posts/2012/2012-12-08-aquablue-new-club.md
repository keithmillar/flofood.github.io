<!--start excerpt--> 
<p>A pre Christmas trip to Cork was the order of the day, arriving late afternoon we quickly got settled and then went to the Silver Key for a meal with Flo's Mother.</p>

<p>Sunday morning and I had planned a ride out with John. As is the norm with John all is not what it seem and he has a test the next day, and only wanted a short easy ride, but he had made arrangements for me to go with his new club Aqua Blue. We meet at the Finger Post and I got a good 70 mile workout.</p>
<p>Lalquilla with John and Mairead for food and drinks and general catch up.</p>
<p>Monday was Cork day for coffee and shopping, Flo and her Mother went to a RSA coffee morning while I wandered round he city trying not to spend any money. We meet up later for more coffee and the I had a call from Garth to tell me Helena's Father had Died and they where making plans to come home for the funeral and then over to us for Christmas.</p>
<p>Tuesday and the long drive home, which turned out to be not too bad as the traffic was light and we made good time without rushing.</p>
