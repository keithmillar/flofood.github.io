<p>The drive to Keem Beach was very hilly with great scenery, the beach it's self was fantastic got some good shots of Lotti and flo. Luckily we had finished when a Coach load of tourists arrived so it was time to leave.  </p>

<p>Drove round to the abandoned Village and then more Coffee where we watched some poor unfortunates trying to break into their car.</p>

<p> We walked to Alices Bar for some food and meet some Canadians from Novia Socia looking for directions, naturally we got soaked both ways heavy rain and strong winds but still quit mild.</p>
