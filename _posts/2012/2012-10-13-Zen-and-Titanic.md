<p>Frank and Kath spent the weekend with us and on Sat night we went to Zen for a meal, as to be expected it was very nice great atmosphere.   </p>

<p>Sunday and we went to the new titanic expo in Belfast, very well done for a change it looks like we have got something right although I suspect our politicians had little to do with it. To finish the day off we had Afternoon Tea and very nice it was.</p>
