<p>Arrive in Cork late last night. Flo off on her Photo Course today and I am left at home, went into Cork City this morning for a look around and had a coffee in Easons. Called in on John for a chat in Douglas cycles then back home. 16:00 hours when I am writing this and the space time continuum down here is well fucked up 1 Cork hour = 10 normal hours </p>
