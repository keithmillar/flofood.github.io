<p>Coffee and Grocery Shopping this morning then back home for Lunch. Flo fancied going to one of the television masts and view points but as soon as we left the house the mist came down and the wind got even stronger. When we got there, there where some guys painting the mast could not believe anyone would work in such poor and dangerous conditions</p>

<p>Having seen the waves from the mountain we decided to have a closer look, the wind was wild and the mist very low but the beach was great, and the wind surfers worth watching.  </p>
