<p>Colin and bev had their Haloween party on Saturday night, the crac was mighty and it was good to catch up with everyone and to see the children growing up.</p>

<p>Sunday was a more relaxed day, went to Castle Espie for morning coffee and read the paper, the in the evening we went to the Parlour for tea and a few pints.</p>
