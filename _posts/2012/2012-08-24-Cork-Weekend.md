<p>Friday afternoon and off to Annalonge for a call of Flo's then all round the coast to Newry and Cork. The weather on the way down was crap very heavy showers, but we arrived in good time. </p>

<p> When we arrived I was able to get the broadband set up straight away which was a relief. And all pc connected first time, the wireless printer was a little harder but once I figured out the software all was good.</p>

<p>Saturday was spending day and we all descended on Dywers electrical and quite quickly bought a Philips smart TV and A Dyson DC39 vacumn. Back home and we got everything up and running with minumin fuss.</p>

<p> Flo and I then headed up to her uncle Hugh's house to have a look around, and  to see if her cigarette cards could be found, naturally their was no sign of them! Michael having let us in left us to our own devices and Flo went through the house with a fine tooth comb finding many photos and letters which she duly rescued. Later that night we went to the Luanne for a meal </p>

<p>Sunday was patio day.</p>  

<p>Sunday Evening we meet up with John &amp; Mairead in Bully's where we caught up with the latest gossip, John had just ridden the Sean Kelly sportif with about 6500 other riders. We had a good night and agreed to think about going to Spain next year.</p>

<p>Monday a few small jobs and a trip to the Dump, and the we where off home. This time the drive was more plesent bright and sunny.</p>
