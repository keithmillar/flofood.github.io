<!--start excerpt--> 
<p>Lotti was in the vet's all day yesterday having her cruciate fix. The operation was a success so we where able to collect her this afternoon.</p>

<p> Got her home and it was like she never had any surgery, except for the stitches and the shaved leg, we had to stop her from running outof the vet's.</p>
