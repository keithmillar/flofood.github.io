<p>As normal with Gentoo when things start to go wrong they just keep getting
worse. First kdepy4 gave trouble had to downgrade sip, that sort of fixed
that. Then kdepim4 wouldn't compile, ended up leaving it, hopefully it will be
fixed in the next few days. Must spend some time tidying up portage keywords
etc.</p>
