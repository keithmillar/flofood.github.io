<!--start excerpt-->

<p>Monday and we went to the new James Bond film Skyfall which was very good and we got the cinema almost to our selves.</p>

<p>Wednesday we both went out on our bikes and I meet up with Flo in Bowbell and we came back with the club.</p>
<p>Thursday we went into Belfast for lunch and a look around town. The town was very quite which suited me fine, Flo took me to Murial's for lunch which was nice. Great to see Belfast becoming a proper city with tourests and people doing normal things.</p>
<p>Sunday and Judy was up for the Irish Experts Trial which was cancled so we went to the Parlour for a meal.</p>
