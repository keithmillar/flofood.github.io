<p>Started to get a feel for emacs to day, and it did take nearly all day. Finding information is not a problem finding current and relevant info can be a real challenge. How ever I did get the colour theme working and formatted the date in the calendar for European formatting. I even added the Moto GP and World Super Bike dates. Now all I have to do is put it all all together and start org mode. </p>

<p>On another note Garth rang to day, all the work at the house has been done so he hopes to fly home tomorrow or Wednesday at the latest.</p>
