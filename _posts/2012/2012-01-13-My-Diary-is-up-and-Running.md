<p>With a little bit of messing around I got Steve Kemp's Chronicle up and
running on kzone. This could be a nice Blog/Diary project. </p>
<p>I Have been working with the two Colins down in Carnalea Golf Club for most
of the week, hopefully today was the finish.</p>
<p>Entered some of the club members into the database for Flo this
afternoon.</p>
