<p>Well to day finally came, never really thought it would. Woke up an Flo had lots of cards and presents for me to open, but the special one was my new Focus Cayo fortunately it was too wet to go out on it.</p>

<div class="figure">

</div>

<p>Using the old reliable Cannondale I went for coffee in Bowbells and got soaked on the way there.</p>
<p>Friday evening We meet up with the Perrys and McCoshes in Daft Eddys for a meal and some crac, we had a great night and the children where very well behaved.</p>
