We went for a drive this morning with the intention of stopping at the river Quoile near Downpatrick for a small picnic, but when we got there it was very quite so we decided to continue on to Saint Patricks Rd where there is a Monument to St Patrick.

We watched some heavy showers crossing the country and headed off for our picnic.

I thought that there was a car park near Strangford with good views of the lough, after some searching we found Cloughy Rocks a very small nature reserve with good views over Strangford Lough where we saw loads of seals basking on the rocks in the warm sunshine.
