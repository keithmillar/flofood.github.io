After yesterdays exertions we decided to have an easy day today, and it was a bit windy to cycle.

So after a late breakfast and a walk with Lotti, we drove to Achill and reacquainted our selves with home bakery, and yet again it came up trumphs.

A quick walk round the local shops and then a spin to Keel to see where the wind surfing would be held.

We came back to the cottage and lazed around for the rest of the day drinking wine.
